# teleprompter
An open source teleprompter running in your browser. What a time to be alive.

### TODO:
- [x] Sticky clocks
- [x] Text scale adjustment
- [x] Keep pop content when refreshing pop
- [x] Keep pop link when refreshing pop
- [x] Keep prompter link when refreshing prompter (works by pressing Popup again)
- [x] Continuous deployment
- [x] Remove /html from path
- [x] Button to update pop content
- [x] Add control page text scale component
- [x] Prompt message
- [x] Keep prompter display settings on next open
- [ ] Stop multiple clock cycles when multiple clock start button presses
- [ ] Space bar scroll start/stop
- [ ] On update content, scroll to same location
- [ ] Red negative clock
- [ ] Change scroll speed progress control to a vertical scale control

### Future
- [ ] Keep prompter display position on screen after being moved (requires polling)
- [ ] Automatically invert dark text on paste
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Prompter preview render
- [ ] Rename project to "Prompter"?
- [ ] Prompter themes/layouts (CSS based)
- [ ] User accounts 
- [ ] Saved documents 
- [ ] Export document 
- [ ] Import document 
- [ ] Game controller 

### Thoughts:
#### Rendering
Should I render the prompter in a canvas and then stream it to the prompter? Might have to do this anyway for the BMD integration. #future
